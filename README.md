# Tour-guide
The developer goal is to create a tour guide app which presents relevant information to a user whoâ€™s visiting your city. 
The app lists top attractions, restaurants, public places, or events for the city. 
It contains all the best known secrets that only locals know.
It includes:
Building layouts to display those lists of data.
Navigating between those lists using intents and multiple Activities or a ViewPager.
Creating your own custom classes.
